					<h1>So You Want to Hike the Appalachian Trail</h1>
          <p>The Appalachian Trail, or the "AT," is a 2,200-mile footpath which winds its way along the East Coast of the United States from Springer Mountain in Northern Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Central Maine.</p>
					<p>Each year about 5,000 adventurous souls will set out to complete the entire trail in under a year. 25% will drop out within the first 30 miles. Just 20% will make it to the end.</p>

					<h1>Meet Your Trail Family</h1>
          <p>"Thru-hikers" come from a wide range of places and backgrounds:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>High school or college graduates</li>
							<li>Former military members and Peace Corps volunteers</li>
							<li>Folks in between jobs</li>
							<li>Recent retirees or divorcees</li>
							<li>Honeymooners</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The commonality that all of these people share is a sense of adventure.

	      <div class="page_container">
					<h1>Timing is Everything</h1>
					<p>The average thru-hiker will need six months to walk end-to-end. <br>If you start too early in the year from Georgia, you're likely to battle winter weather. <br>If you start too late, you'll have to race to beat Mount Katahdin's October 15th closing date. <br>About 10% of thru-hikers elect to walk southbound. They normally begin their journey around June.</p>

			<section class="cost">
		    <div class="page_container">
					<h1>$1,000 per month!</h1>
					<p>Provided you don't have any bills off the trail, $6,000 for a thru-hike should be plenty sufficient. This works out to just over $30 per day.<br>While the cost of food (ramen noodles) is minimal, unforseen costs such as shoe and gear replacement, a trip to New York City, and zero days (days off in town), can add up quickly. <br>Costs associated with recreational drugs, alcohol and tobacco eat into many hikers' budgets as well.</p>

					<h1>Choosing a Backpack</h1>
					<p>Normally when you move place-to-place, you have the luxury of moving trucks or U-Haul trailers. On the AT, you have no such luxury. You must carry all of your belongings.<br> Backpacks come in a wide variety of sizes and styles. Ultralight hikers manage to keep their weight down to 20lbs while others burden themselves with 50lbs of equipment.<br>There are two approaches: Buy the pack first and only take what fits, or you can buy everything else and buy a pack that holds it all.</p>

			<section class="shelter">
			  <div class="page_container">
					<h1>Shelters</h1>
					<p>When it comes to resting your head at night, you have four main options: You can stay in one of the 200+ shelters along the way, bring a tent or hammock, or sleep under the stars with or without a tarp.<br>Shelters are often crowded and there's no guarantee that you'll get one of the usual 10 spots. Tents can be heavy, but there are options under 2lbs. Hammocks work just about anywhere. Tarps and sleeping in the dirt are the lighest options for those who are comfortable sharing a bed with the occasional critter.</p>

			<section class="bag">
			  <div class="page_container">
					<h1>Sleeping Bags</h1>
					<p>If you begin your journey before April, it's advisable to bring a sleeping bag or quilt which will keep you warm if the temperatures dip into the 20s. In the late spring and summer, most hikers mail their bags home and carry a lightweight fleece or synthetic blanket.<br>Many hikers bring inflatable or foam sleeping pads to increase comfort. Ultralight backpackers typically do not. If there is one piece of equipment that you should spend good money on, a sleep system is it.</p>

			<section class="food">
			  <div class="page_container">
					<h1>Food</h1>
					<p>Food can be divided into two categories. Food you cook and food you don't. While a warm meal can do wonders for the soul, many hikers forgo the additional weight of a stove.<br>A chief consideration of those shopping for a resupply is the calorie-to-weight ratio.<br>You'll burn 5,000-6,000 calories per day. A heavy can of soup won't get you far. Pasta, lentils, rice, peanut butter and chips are trail favorites. Empty calories are not. Also to consider is the cost per calorie. In terms of energy and taste, expensive prepackaged "backpacking" meals are usually not worth the money.</p>

			<section class="water">
			  <div class="page_container">
					<h1>Hydration</h1>
					<p>When it comes to water, the Appalachians are bountiful. While drinking straight from lakes and streams is not advisable (giardia), some hikers choose not to treat any water along the way. If giardia isn't your thing, there are a few options. Most hikers filter their water with universal filters which screw on to the top of most water bottles. A handful of backpackers treat each liter with a few drops of household bleach. New to the hiking scene are ultra-violet sterilization pens.<br>Avoid retrieving water from sources near cattle or crops. Always filter a minimum of two liters. Springs can be unreliable.</p>

			<section class="firstaid">
			  <div class="page_container">
					<h1>First Aid</h1>
					<p>Hiker first-aid kits are typically small and contain band-aids, athletic tape, needles, thread, acetaminophin, vaseline and duct tape. You can leave the snake-bite kit at home.<br>Many hikers are now electing to carry a satellite transponder in the event they face a medical emergency. With one push of a button, a helicopter or rescue crew will rush to your side. Not interested in paying six-figures for an evacuation? Rescue insurance is available for just a few dollars per month.</p>
